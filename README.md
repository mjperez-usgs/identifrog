IdentiFrog is a Java based application that allows users to use pictures of Leopard frogs to identify them at a later date using signatures generated from the spots on their dorsals.

Need
-----
Identification of individual animals is needed for studying population demography and movement patterns and is the basis for mark-recapture analyses. Animals with unique body markings (e.g., spot patterns) are fairly easily identified by the human eye from photographs. Photo-matching provides a non-invasive alternative identification method but has been limited to small datasets because of time and effort requirements of manual searches.

Goal
-----
The Identifrog software was developed to improve photo-matching of frogs for research purposes. The Identifrog prototype uses a spot-pattern recognition algorithm to identify individual northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens) using images of their dorsal spot pattern. The algorithm consists of multiple reduction steps that reduce false matching images at each step. The system returns the top ten ranked individuals as closest matches along with a classification of these into ‘probable’ versus ‘not so probable’ categories. The classification serves as an indication whether the query individual was previously captured or not.

Project Status
-----
This project is currently under active development and is not yet at a stage where it is usable. It should become usable in the next few months.
