# Introduction #

## Need ##
Identification of individual animals is needed for studying population demography and  movement patterns and is the basis for mark-recapture analyses. Animals with unique body markings (e.g., spot patterns) are fairly easily identified by the human eye from photographs. Photo-matching provides a non-invasive alternative identification method but has been limited to small datasets because of time and effort requirements of manual searches.

## Goal ##
The Identifrog software was developed to improve photo-matching of frogs for research purposes. The Identifrog prototype uses a spot-pattern recognition algorithm to identify individual northern leopard frogs (_Lithobates pipiens_) using images of their dorsal spot pattern. The algorithm consists of multiple reduction steps that reduce false matching images at each step. The system returns the top ten ranked individuals as closest matches along with a classification of these into ‘probable’ versus ‘not so probable’ categories. The classification serves as an indication whether the query individual was previously captured or not.

## Beta-testing ##
In this Beta stage of the project, we encourage users to use the software on leopard frogs (or possibly other frogs with distinct spots) and report problems or ideas for improvement to the developers via this website.

# Update about a Bug in the Application #
We have found a bug in the application that does not allow the application to match the frogs that a user has entered. We are working on this bug and will have an updated version of the application available for our users soon. If you have downloaded this application and have started to enter the frogs, please let us know. **This issue has been fixed.**

# "Save As" Bug - still not fixed #
Be warned that the "save as" feature of this program is still not working.  If you use the program, do not try to create a new site or save as.  Just run the program in its base mode.  We are working on a fix for this problem and hope to have it resolved in mid-2014.  Thank you for your patience.
